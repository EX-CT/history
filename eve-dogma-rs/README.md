# eve-dogma-rs

Stateless, deterministic **EVE Online fitting engine** in Rust (part of the EX-CT open fitting tool,
design docs: [EX-CT/eve-fit-docs](https://github.com/EX-CT/eve-fit-docs)).

* **Input:** one JSON `FitRequest` (ship, modules + charges + states, drones, fighters, implants, boosters,
  skills, projected effects, fleet buffs, environment, damage pattern, target profile, overrides, options),
  see `schema/fit-request.schema.json` in eve-fit-docs.
* **Output:** one JSON `FitStats` (resources, slots, offense, defense, tank, capacitor simulation,
  navigation, targeting, drones, validation violations, optional attribute dumps). The same request
  always produces byte-identical output.
* **Data:** a compact dataset built from CCP's official SDE by
  [EX-CT/eve-sde-pipeline](https://github.com/EX-CT/eve-sde-pipeline) (`dataset-<build>.json.gz`, release assets).
  Modifiers come from the SDE `modifierInfo`; effects CCP ships without it are covered by
  small data patches in the pipeline and a few documented engine specials.

## Install

Prebuilt CLI binaries are attached to every `v*` release of this repository (built by
`.github/workflows/release.yml`): `eve-dogma-<tag>-<platform>.tar.gz` for `linux-x86_64`, `linux-aarch64`,
`macos-x86_64`, `macos-arm64`, and `eve-dogma-<tag>-windows-x86_64.zip`. Each archive holds the `eve-dogma`
binary, this README and the licenses; `SHA256SUMS` covers all archives. Linux builds need glibc 2.34+
(Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, RHEL 9 or newer); there are no other runtime dependencies. Maintainers: a manual run
of the `release` workflow (default `dry_run`) builds and packages all five targets as run artifacts without
touching any release; pushing a `v*` tag builds them again and uploads them.

```bash
# 1. binary (pick your platform; with the GitHub CLI, or download the same files from the release page)
TAG=$(gh release view -R EX-CT/eve-dogma-rs --json tagName -q .tagName)
gh release download "$TAG" -R EX-CT/eve-dogma-rs --pattern "eve-dogma-$TAG-linux-x86_64.tar.gz" --pattern SHA256SUMS
sha256sum --ignore-missing -c SHA256SUMS
tar xzf "eve-dogma-$TAG-linux-x86_64.tar.gz"
install -m 755 "eve-dogma-$TAG-linux-x86_64/eve-dogma" ~/.local/bin/    # or anywhere on PATH

# 2. dataset: latest release of EX-CT/eve-sde-pipeline (dataset-<build>[-r<rev>].json.gz + manifest.json)
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/eve-dogma && cd ~/.local/share/eve-dogma
gh release download -R EX-CT/eve-sde-pipeline --pattern 'dataset-*.json.gz' --pattern manifest.json --clobber
python3 -c "import json,hashlib;m=json.load(open('manifest.json'));assert hashlib.sha256(open(m['file'],'rb').read()).hexdigest()==m['sha256_gz'];print('ok',m['file'])"
ln -sf "$(ls dataset-*.json.gz | sort | tail -1)" dataset.json.gz
export EVE_DOGMA_DATASET=~/.local/share/eve-dogma/dataset.json.gz   # add to your shell profile

# 3. check
eve-dogma meta          # dataset sha256 / SDE build / counts
```

On macOS use `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS` (unsigned binary: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine eve-dogma` if
Gatekeeper blocks it). On Windows, unzip the archive, check it with `Get-FileHash`, and set
`$env:EVE_DOGMA_DATASET` to the downloaded dataset. Without `gh`, take the files from
<https://github.com/EX-CT/eve-sde-pipeline/releases/latest>.

Dataset lookup order: `--dataset PATH`, then `$EVE_DOGMA_DATASET`, then `./dataset.json.gz`. The first run on
a dataset parses it (about 100 ms) and writes a bincode cache to `$EVE_DOGMA_CACHE_DIR` (default
`<tmp>/eve-dogma-cache`; point it at a persistent directory such as `~/.cache/eve-dogma` if your tmp is cleared
at boot). Later runs load the cache in about 10 ms. The cache is keyed by the dataset contents and the
executable, so upgrading either one rebuilds it once; `EVE_DOGMA_NO_CACHE=1` disables it.

To build from source instead: `cargo install --git https://github.com/EX-CT/eve-dogma-rs --locked` (Rust stable).

## Quick start

```bash
gh release download -R EX-CT/eve-sde-pipeline --pattern 'dataset-*.json.gz'
mv dataset-*.json.gz dataset.json.gz            # or set EVE_DOGMA_DATASET
cargo build --release
./target/release/eve-dogma eft tests/fits/exct_rifter.eft --calc --skills 5   # EFT -> stats
./target/release/eve-dogma eft tests/fits/exct_rifter.eft > req.json          # EFT -> FitRequest
./target/release/eve-dogma calc req.json                                      # FitRequest -> FitStats
./target/release/eve-dogma search "Hammerhead"                                # en + zh names
./target/release/eve-dogma serve-stdio      # JSONL RPC: calc | eft_parse | eft_export | search | type | meta
./target/release/eve-dogma bench req.json -n 2000
```

Dataset revisions: any `sde-3569502` revision (r1–r4) gives identical results. Effects flagged `"stacking_exempt": true`
(r4: incursion effect 4728) are never stacking-penalised. When the dataset carries OffensiveDefensiveReduction as
stacking-exempt modifiers, they are applied generically instead of the engine-side handler, so nothing is applied
twice. The burst-projector patch (0101) stays engine-side.

Cold start: the parsed dataset is cached as bincode in `$EVE_DOGMA_CACHE_DIR` (default `<tmp>/eve-dogma-cache`),
keyed by a 128-bit content hash of the dataset file and the executable's size/mtime (the reported
`meta.dataset_sha256` is the real SHA-256, computed on the first parse). The 6 most recent entries are kept. Each type
is stored as one packed record and decoded on its first lookup, so a cached cold start decodes only the few hundred
types a fit touches (about 17 M instructions for a whole `calc` process). A whole cached `calc` process takes about
10 ms; an uncached one takes about 100 ms. The output is byte-identical. Disable with `EVE_DOGMA_NO_CACHE=1`.

Library: `eve_dogma::calc(&Dataset, &FitRequest) -> serde_json::Value` (pure; no I/O, clocks or globals).

## What is modelled

Data-driven dogma (all CCP operators incl. PostPercent/PostAssign, per-operator stacking penalty buckets
with exempt categories, min/max attribute caps, skill/ship/module/charge/implant/booster/mode/subsystem
modifiers), AB/MWD/MJD, T3D modes (default mode like the client), T3C subsystems (slots/hardpoints),
structures (pilot skills/implants ignored, power state, security modifiers), mutated modules/drones,
spool-up weapons, missiles (pilot `missileDamageMultiplier`), drones, fighters (Pyfa default abilities),
smartbombs/vorton, local reps incl. AAR paste, passive shield regen, Reactive Armor Hardener adaptation,
capacitor simulation (Pyfa-compatible event simulation incl. injectors, nosferatu income, staggering),
local command bursts, explicit fleet buffs and fleet booster fits (strongest buff wins), projected
webs/TPs/damps/sebos/ECM/drones/whole fits with range falloff, scripts and resistances, incoming remote
shield/armor/hull reps (Pyfa diminishing returns) and neuts/nos/cap transfers in the cap sim, wormhole environments, validation (CPU/PG/calibration/bandwidth, slots, hardpoints, canFitShip*, rig size,
max group fitted/online/active, charge compatibility, skill requirements), EFT import/export incl. mutations.

## Accuracy: Pyfa oracle

`oracle/pyfa_oracle.py` runs Pyfa's eos engine headless as a **black box** (GPL-3.0 test tool, never linked).
`oracle/compare.py` builds each case (EFT in `tests/fits/` or JSON case in `tests/cases/`), runs both engines
and compares 48 fit metrics plus per-weapon optimal/falloff/tracking and missile range/explosion radius/velocity. `WRITE_EXPECTED=1` freezes Pyfa's numbers into `tests/oracle/pyfa_expected.json`,
which `cargo test` checks (no Python needed in CI).

Current: **249/249 cases, 13 812 values match Pyfa** (rel. 1e-4) — 101 dogma-engine community/regression fits,
24 hand-written fits (frigates, cruisers, BS, HAC, T3C, T3D, marauders in bastion, logi,
carriers/supercarrier fighters, command ships, mining), 124 JSON cases (skills 0/2/3/4, damage patterns, RAH
profiles, reload, projected webs/TP/damps/ECM/scripts/web+neut drones, projected whole fits, remote reps,
neuts/nos/cap transfers, fleet booster fits, wormhole environments C1–C6, implant sets, combat boosters).
The same corpus is the shared bench `EX-CT/eve-dogma-bench`. 5 metrics are recorded as explained divergences
(Pyfa data older than SDE, invalid fits, structure power state) — see `KNOWN` in `oracle/compare.py`.

## Performance (same box, 1 core, all-V skills, including capacitor simulation)

| fit | eve-dogma | Pyfa (warm) | speed-up |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rifter | 1.15 ms | 10.8 ms | 9.4× |
| Vexor | 2.32 ms | 31.2 ms | 13.4× |
| Tengu | 1.23 ms | 15.3 ms | 12.5× |
| Nidhoggur | 1.48 ms | 14.8 ms | 10.0× |
| Hyperion | 1.35 ms | 17.1 ms | 12.7× |

Dataset load: ~150 ms (once per process). Pyfa first calculation: ~390 ms.

## WebAssembly (WASI)

The same engine builds for `wasm32-wasip1`. The native-only mimalloc allocator is left out on wasm32, and the dataset
cache is skipped (each process parses the dataset). The output is byte-identical to the native build: CI's `wasm` job
checks this, and all 326 bench cases match locally.

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1          # target/wasm32-wasip1/release/eve-dogma.wasm (~1.4 MB)
node wasm/run.mjs dataset.json.gz calc < request.json # Node's built-in WASI, no extra tools
wasmtime run --dir /path/to/data::/d target/wasm32-wasip1/release/eve-dogma.wasm --dataset /d/dataset.json.gz calc < request.json
```

All CLI commands (`calc`, `batch`, `serve-stdio`, `eft`, `search`, `type`, `meta`) work. In a browser the module runs
through any WASI preview1 shim, with the dataset provided as a file in the shim's virtual filesystem.
